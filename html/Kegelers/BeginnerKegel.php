  $prodDesc = "These Kegel Balls were designed with the beginner in mind! Shaped into two smooth 
  swells, the balls nestle naturally along the curves of the vaginal wall, helping you target your 
  pelvic floor muscles. These magic muscles are responsible for improved inner snugness, better 
  control of continence after childbirth or surgery, the possibility of stronger, more intense 
  orgasms and an overall happier vagina. You'll grip and release the balls during kegel exercises 
  or you can forgo the workout and focus on deep inner sensation. Insert one at a time to get the 
  full effect, or just give a single ball a try. They weigh .8oz/22.7grams each, perfect for the 
  kegel beginner. Made from ABS Plastic, these balls clean easily with warm, soapy water or a good 
  toy cleaner. They are also compatible with water and silicone-based lubes. <br /><br />

  <em>*The Balls measure approximately 1.25‚Äù/3.2cm in diameter </em>
