  Built for pleasure, these balls will strengthen your pelvic muscles which leads to stronger, more 
  intense orgasms. Each ball contains a weighted bead that causes organic vibrations with your 
  movement while stimulating and massaging you. Simply insert both beads and use your pelvic muscles 
  to hold them in place. Try using them while exercising, in the shower, or around the house. It only 
  takes a few weeks of dedicated use to start feeling noticeably stronger. <br /><br />
