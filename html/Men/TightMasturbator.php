  Sakura's Tight Masturbator. In sparkly pink, this soft sleeve features a snug, 
  non-detailed entrance, a very lifelike inner texture, and a closed-ended design 
  that naturally creates lots of suction. This masturbator is perfectly 
  squeezable which allows you or your partner to easily customize just how tight 
  Sakura grips your penis. Use water-based lubes to make it slippery. It can 
  easily be cleaned with warm, soapy water or a good toy cleaner. <br/><br/>
