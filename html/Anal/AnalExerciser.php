  its long, strategically swollen shape. It provides an exciting challenge to 
  rear-pleasure seekers progressing to more filling penetration. Simple and 
  user-friendly, the double-tiered Advanced Exerciser is sleek and manageable, 
  flexing subtly for comfort and precision placement. Featuring a wide circular base 
  enhanced by sturdy suction, the Advanced Exerciser can be secured against just 
  about any smooth, flat surface for hands free play. The base also protects against 
  travel and overly deep penetration. Made from smooth TPR that is compatible with 
  water or silicone-based lube and cleans easily using warm, soapy water or a good 
  toy cleaner.";
