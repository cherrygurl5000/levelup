  perfect set of user-friendly beads to get you started. The beads are connected 
  with a flexible cord for the best placement during solo use or with a partner. 
  They gradually and subtly grow to assist in allowing you to get fully accustomed 
  to the new feeling of each bead. The retrieval handle makes the beads safe and 
  easy to maneuver, and keeps insertion and retrieval foolproof. Made from a 
  phthalate-free PVC material, these beads are easy to clean with warm, soapy 
  water or a good toy cleaner. They are also compatible with water or 
  silicone-based lubricants.";
