  balls, but geared toward anal bliss. They are completely discreet and are used 
  internally to create a distinctly unique stimulation. Linked by a flexible, 
  silicone strand and finished with a looped handle, the Balls can be removed and 
  manipulated easily. For an enhanced experience, the package includes two protective, 
  rubber finger sleeves, samples of Moist water-based lube and Anal Eaze cream, and a 
  small bottle of Refresh toy cleaner. <br />

  Silicone makes it easy to warm and cool the toy before play. It also makes it easy 
  to clean and/or sterilize this toy using boiling water. Compatible with water-based 
  lubricants, ensure that you avoid silicone-based lubes and other silicone toys and 
  products.
