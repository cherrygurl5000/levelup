  boxers or otherwise. This packer not only provides a nice, full look under clothing and lets its 
  wearer stand to pee, it's also ready to play! Sculpted to fit snugly against the crotch, the STP 
  is soft enough to be bent and positioned for natural wear, though it's a tad firmer than average 
  which is better if you're after a noticeable bulge. That same firmness comes in pretty handy in 
  the bathroom as well. The STP holds steady as the hollow shape and open tip make nature's calls 
  stress-free. Made from silicone, this packer can be cleaned easily with warm, soapy water or a 
  good toy cleaner. Although it is compatible with water-based lubes, you should avoid 
  silicone-based lubes and other silicone products.";
