  adults-only version of the classic party game where players take turns acting out 
  things like Horny Devil, Mr. Woodcock, and The Little Man in the Boat. The goal is 
  to get your teammates to guess as many answers within a minute. After each team 
  member has performed three times, the winners are crowned based on which team has 
  the most points. The game comes with everything for a fun night, 80 cards with 6 
  charades per card, a one-minute timer, and a score pad. Make your next game night 
  a little more exciting with this adult themed masterpiece.";
