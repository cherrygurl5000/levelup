  time with breathtaking vibrations and passionate rhythms. With its ergonomic and 
  flexible shape, it works effortlessly to catapult you and your partner out of this 
  world. The larger head sits on your clitoris, while the smaller shaft is slipped 
  inside to excite your G-Spot. When he inserts his penis, it adds a pleasant 
  tightness and skillfully stimulates both of you on to an ecstatic mutual orgasm.<br />
  The Double Joy is not only fun with a partner present, it can be used alone or with 
  help from the Satisfyer Connect App. Just download the app to your Android or iOS 
  device and connect your smartphone, tablet or Apple Watch via Bluetooth or internet. 
  The app will allow you to create, save, or even download various patterns that 
  seamlessly integrates sensual vibration patterns into both motors of the Double Joy, 
  independently or simultaneously. With the in-app call feature, you can give up 
  control of your new best friend to a partner as long as they are also connected to 
  the app!
